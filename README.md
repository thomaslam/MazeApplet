MazeApplet
==========
This is project #2 for my Independent Study in Computer Science in Loomis Chaffee (my high school).
I learn from online tutorials and advice from my programmer friends.
The program's objective is to randomly generate a maze everytime it starts. The player then can traverse the maze using the arrow keys or let the AI show the solution path.
The data structure I use for grouping the "rooms" together is disjoint data set.
The solving algorithm (so far is A* Star algorithm)
