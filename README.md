MazeApplet
==========
This is project #2 for my Independent Study in Computer Science in Loomis Chaffee (my high school).
I learn from online tutorials and advice from my programmer friends.
The program's objective is to randomly generate a maze everytime it starts. The algorithm for generating the maze is Kruskal's algorithm. The player then can traverse the maze using the arrow keys or let the AI show the solution path.
The data structure I use for grouping the "rooms" together is disjoint data set.
The solving algorithm is simple Depth First Search.
